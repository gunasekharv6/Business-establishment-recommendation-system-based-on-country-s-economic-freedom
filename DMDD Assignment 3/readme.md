Gathering, Scraping, Munging, and Cleaning Data

In this assignment, our team populated our database with real-world data. This process is often called data munging or data wrangling.

The process is as follows:

You must find sources of data. (This can be downloads, XML files, JSON, HTML pages, data repositories, etc.) (10 points)

You must download and reformat the data to fit your database schema. (This involves using web scrapers, web API’s, formatting scripts, parsing files, etc.) (10 points)

You must audit the quality and estimate the amount of data you’ll gather. This involves auditing (i.e. testing to evaluate quality/accuracy - a systematic and independent examination of data). You will need to audit the following:

Audit Validity/ Accuracy (10 points)

Audit Completeness (10 points)

Audit Consistency/Uniformity (10 points)
